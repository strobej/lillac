#### Lillac pass is a secure password generator made with *React*.


You can generate two types of passwords; simple and easy to remember or complex enough that need to be saved somewhere safe.

This application is open source and hosted on https://www.lillacpass.com. You can check the code behind it here. 

New features and improvments will be pushed on an *as-needed basis*.
